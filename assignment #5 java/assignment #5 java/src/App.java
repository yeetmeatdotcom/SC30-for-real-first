//Welcome to Computer Science 30 My Name is (insert your name) and my favourite food is (insert food). Java has all sorta of weird "quirks" which make displaying text a bit more challenging. Sometimes characters like parentheses (sometimes called brackets) don't work correctly. Escape sequences require us to use a backslash '\' in order to output these special characters.
