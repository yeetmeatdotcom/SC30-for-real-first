//Program Description:





//Welcome to Computer Science 30
//My Name is (insert your name) and my favourite food is (insert food).
//Java has all sorta of weird "quirks" which make displaying text a bit more challenging.
//Sometimes characters like parentheses (sometimes called brackets) don't work correctly.
//Escape sequences require us to use a backslash '\' in order to output these special characters.
